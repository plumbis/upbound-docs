    "Channel defines the upgrade channels for Crossplane. We support the following channels where 'Stable' is the default: - None: disables auto-upgrades and keeps the control plane at its current version of Crossplane. - Patch: automatically upgrades the control plane to the latest supported patch version when it becomes available while keeping the minor version the same. - Stable: automatically upgrades the control plane to the latest supported patch release on minor version N-1, where N is the latest supported minor version. - Rapid: automatically upgrades the cluster to the latest supported patch release on the latest supported minor version."
