    SharedSecretStore represents a shared SecretStore projected as ClusterSecretStore into matching ControlPlanes in the same namespace. Once projected into a ControlPlane, it can be referenced from ExternalSecret instances, as part of `storeRef` fields. The secret store configuration including referenced credential are not leaked into the ControlPlanes and in that sense can be called secure as they are invisible to the ControlPlane workloads.
